# Hill-Climbing-Algorithm-Comparison

Simple comparison between brute force algorithm & genetic algorithm w/ string similarity fitness function for cracking passwords of various lengths. Genetic algorithms shown to be exponentially more efficient than brute force counterpart as password length increases
